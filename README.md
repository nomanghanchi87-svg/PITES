How to use:
1. Extract the ZIP and open index.html in any modern browser.
2. The site uses external images from Unsplash (hotlinked). If you want local copies, download the images and place them in an 'images' folder, then update the <img> and CSS background URLs.
3. To make forms functional, connect the form action to a backend (PHP/Node) or use services like Formspree or Netlify forms.
4. Customization: change phone/email/logo text in the header and contact section as needed.
